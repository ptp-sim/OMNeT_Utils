Step 1: Requirements

    OMNeT++ is required:
    See https://omnetpp.org/

    This release is tested with OMNeT++ 4.6

    Commands in the following steps are meant to be called from
    a shell with the OMNeT++ binaries in its path, and from the
    top project folder

Step 2: Generate makefiles

    Run the following shell script:
    Make_Makefiles.sh

Step 3a: Build project on command line

    Command for debug build:

    make

    Command for release build:

    make MODE=release

Step 3b: Build project in OMNeT++:

    Instead of using the command line, the project can also
    be built from the OMNeT++ GUI: Select the build configuration
    (release or debug) with right-click on the project ->
    Build Configurations -> Set Active.

    Right click on project -> Build Project
